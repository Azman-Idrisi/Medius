            Homeownership is a huge part of our economy. Housing overall is a
            $33 trillion business, and mortgages account for $15 trillion. Yet
            home finance operates in the same way it has for decades â€” through
            opaque systems and expensive intermediaries whose interests are
            misaligned with consumers&apos;.

            That&apos;s why Better.com is redefining the homeownership process
            from the ground up. We&apos;re using technology to make it faster
            and more efficient, and humans to help make it friendly and
            enjoyable.
